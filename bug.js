In React Router Dom v6,  a common issue arises when navigating to a route that doesn't exist or when a route path is incorrectly defined. This can lead to unexpected behavior, like the app crashing or displaying a blank screen.  For instance:

```javascript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/home" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        {/* Incorrect path, should be /contact */}
        <Route path="/contactt" element={<Contact />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
```

If a user tries to access '/contact', it'll result in a 404 or a blank page because the path is mistyped.
